Project Diamond is an attempt to build a monetary system for digital
economy which is backed by strong cryptography. The goal is to
research and build software libraries, protocols, and other tools that
can sustain high volumes of monetary transactions at very low
overheads. In particular, the system should be capable of handling, in
real time, micro-payments of large economies like that of India.

## Contributions.

One of the topics that we wish to explore is blind signature based
digital currency along the lines of Chaum's [digicash] or the more
recent [Gnu taler][taler] system. We would like to scale these so that
it is possible to:

1. Make micro-payments is real time.

2. Make transactions using low end phones, i.e. ones that are called
   feature phones.

Besides, we would like to explore other financial instruments like
cheques, which are relatively less challenging cryptographically than
digital currency.


## Commitment to open standards.

Monetary systems are community resources and hence should be free from
vendor lock-in unlike some of the payment systems that are popular
currently. Project Diamond aims to be a community project that follows
the best practices of the world of free and open source software. In
particular, we pledge to

1. Release all software, documentation or any other digital artefacts
   under suitable permissible licences like BSD-3 or Creative Commons.
   Besides being free for individual users, we welcome integration of
   our software in commercial products.

2. _Not_ enforce any kind of "intellectual property rights" on any of
   the ideas, software or protocols developed as part of this project.

We welcome contributions from anyone as long as it _does not_ hinder
our commitments listed above. Contributions to our projects should be
through public pull requests to our repositories and we consider such
a pull request as an agreement by the author to adhere the above
commitments. If you, or your employer wish to lock some of your
contributions under intellectual property laws, _do not_ send us those
pull requests.

Finally a note of caution. While every effort will be made to ensure
that the artefacts that we develop would be secure they come _without
any warranties_. You cannot hold us responsible for any direct or
indirect damages that might result from using them.
